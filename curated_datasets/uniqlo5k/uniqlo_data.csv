Andy Warhol
As the preeminent American artist of the 20th Century, Andy Warhol challenged the world to see art differently. This product is produced under a license from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc., a New York not-for-profit corporation which promotes the visual arts.
Keith Haring
A key figure in New York’s East Village scene in the late 1970s and 80s, American artist Keith Haring’s artwork populated not only art galleries, but also the city’s subways, streets, and sidewalks. His work often combined an iconographic vocabulary, including hearts, flying saucers, winged figures, and a crawling “radiant baby,”with abstract marks and patterning.
Jean-Michel Basquiat
An icon of New York in the 1980s, Jean-Michel Basquiat became renowned during his short career for works inspired by his early street art and a distinctive iconography often connected to art history. His paintings, drawings, and prints drew on a diverse range of sources, from African, Aztec, and Greek cultures to Americana in the form of jazz, baseball, and social and political events.

Andy Warhol
As the preeminent American artist of the 20th Century, Andy Warhol challenged the world to see art differently. This product is produced under a license from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc., a New York not-for-profit corporation which promotes the visual arts.
Keith Haring
A key figure in New York’s East Village scene in the late 1970s and 80s, American artist Keith Haring’s artwork populated not only art galleries, but also the city’s subways, streets, and sidewalks. His work often combined an iconographic vocabulary, including hearts, flying saucers, winged figures, and a crawling “radiant baby,”with abstract marks and patterning.
Jean-Michel Basquiat
An icon of New York in the 1980s, Jean-Michel Basquiat became renowned during his short career for works inspired by his early street art and a distinctive iconography often connected to art history. His paintings, drawings, and prints drew on a diverse range of sources, from African, Aztec, and Greek cultures to Americana in the form of jazz, baseball, and social and political events.

We do not believe that a T-shirt can express much of a philosophical message. But it does eventually inspire some thoughts, make you imagine some dream or hear some song of a peaceful past. That is what we need so much these days.

Takeshi Yoro
Anatomist / Born in 1937 in Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture. Anatomist. Graduated from the University of Tokyo Faculty of Medicine. Professor Emeritus at the University of Tokyo. Author of the 2003 best-seller The Wall of Fools, he is the recipient of awards from the Shingo Ryukogo Taisho buzzword contest and the Mainichi Publishing Culture Awards. The books in his “Wall” series have sold millions of copies. A known lover of cats and insects, he conceived of the idea for MushizuKa, an innovative memorial to insect life at Kamakura’s Kencho-ji Temple.
Focusing on peace makes perfect sense. With so much of the world looking for peace, how can it be any other way? This T-shirt is a tribute to my late cat, Maru. When a stray cat took its food, Maru didn’t get upset until a minute after the other cat was gone. A cat who could not fight. Though perhaps that’s for the best. The time has come to give peace our undivided attention.

I learn so much from the people I photograph. Working with people in Aw-barre Camp, Hope, Dreams, and Resilience became a central conversation I wanted my work to represent.

CRISTINA DE MIDDEL
Magnum Photos’ President / Cristina de Middel investigates photography’s ambiguous relationship to truth. Blending documentary and conceptual photographic practices, she plays with reconstructions and archetypes in order to build a more layered understanding of the subjects she approaches. Working from the premise that mass media is reducing our real understanding of the world we live in, De Middel responds to an urgency to re-imagine tired aesthetic tropes and insert opinion in place of facts. De Middel was born in Spain and is based between Mexico and Brazil. She became a Magnum nominee in 2017 and Magnum President in 2022.
It is well known that creativity sits in our capacity to subvert the given order of things and the meanings we learned in our journey to adulthood. In my work, I reconnect to the absolute power that we are born with and use while we are still children. It's the same power that turns a folded piece of paper into a boat or a pencil into a rocket and I believe that looking at the world as a place you can change and modify is an essential skill to remind the next generation if we want to make a change. Working with these children in Vietnam gave me plenty of hope for what was to come and it was also a lot of fun.",https://image.uniqlo.com/UQ/ST3/us/imagesgoods/476354/item/usgoods_00_476354_3x4.jpg?width=400,,,,,,,https://image.uniqlo.com/UQ/ST3/us/imagesgoods/476354/sub/usgoods_476354_sub1_3x4.jpg?width=400,https://image.uniqlo.com/UQ/ST3/us/imagesgoods/476354/sub/usgoods_476354_sub7_3x4.jpg?width=400,https://image.uniqlo.com/UQ/ST3/WesternCommon/imagesgoods/476354/sub/goods_476354_sub11_3x4.jpg?width=400,https://image.uniqlo.com/UQ/ST3/WesternCommon/imagesgoods/476354/sub/goods_476354_sub14_3x4.jpg?width=400

Julian Opie
Artist/Julian Opie plays with ways of seeing through reinterpreting the vocabulary of everyday life; his reductive style evokes both a visual and spatial experience of the world around us. Influenced by classical portraiture, Egyptian hieroglyphs and Japanese woodblock prints, as well as public signage and traffic signs, Opie connects the clean visual language of modern life, with the fundamentals of art history.
""People passing on the street in every town in every country all busy and focused, engaged in their lives and concerns. These people were walking in Busan, South Korea but they could be anywhere really, part of a constant flow of people around the world. I read a lot of history books and so much of it is about war and conflict. I have to remind myself that most of the time people were just going about their business walking the streets in the mornings to work or to see friends.""

Emmanuelle Moureaux
Architect , Artist, Designer / French architect, artist and designer living in Tokyo since 1996. Inspired by the layers and colors of Tokyo that built a complex depth and density on the street, and the traditional spatial elements like sliding screens, she has created the concept of ""shikiri"", which literally means ""dividing (creating) space with colors"". Using colors as her signature, her works extend to a number of projects, including architectural design for Sugamo Shinkin Bank, art installations for UNIQLO and ISSEY MIYAKE, ""100 colors"" art installation series, and ""Forest of Numbers"" at The National Art Center, Tokyo. Professor at Tohoku University of Art and Design.
""When I Saw the Earth for the First Time"" - I imagined a picture book with a title like this. The colorful sphere represents the earth, the yellow sphere represents the sun, and the child holding the balloon is you, the main character. The diversity of living creatures that exist on this earth creates and drives the beauty of the earth. I expressed that through the universality and infinity of color. I hope that colors will move people's hearts.

She became a Magnum nominee in 2017 and Magnum President in 2022.

""I use symbolism in my work a lot and wanted to create an image that meant ""right to peace"" and what fighting for peace carries. Both the fist and the pigeon are symbols for each one of these concepts so I tried to put them together. The picture could have been shot anywhere in the city of Salvador de Bahia, which always has these beautiful clouds.""

Saul Leiter
Photographer / Saul Leiter was a legendary photographer who spent most of his life in New York City. His work appeared in well-known fashion magazines in the 1950s and 1960s, but he stepped away from the front line in the 1980s. His photo collection Early Color was released in 2006, when he was 82 years old, and was a major hit as he rose to prominence as a pioneer of color photography. Retrospectives and publications featuring Saul Leiter continue to be presented around the world, and a documentary film was released in 2013. Saul Leiter passed away in 2013.
Saul Leiter had a knack for capturing peaceful moments that hush the considerable noise of New York City. “It’s been decided that I have a penchant for quietness,” he once said with a chuckle. Whether Leiter is observing a gentle kiss in Times Square amid the hubbub of New Year’s Eve celebrations or finding a solitary young girl in a red coat making a snowball behind a downtown apartment building, the photographer communes with his surroundings to portray a uniquely tranquil vision of his beloved New York.",https://image.uniqlo.com/UQ/ST3/us/imagesgoods/475763/item/usgoods_00_475763_3x4.jpg?width=400,,,,,,,https://image.uniqlo.com/UQ/ST3/us/imagesgoods/475763/sub/usgoods_475763_sub1_3x4.jpg?width=400,https://image.uniqlo.com/UQ/ST3/us/imagesgoods/475763/sub/usgoods_475763_sub7_3x4.jpg?width=400,https://image.uniqlo.com/UQ/ST3/us/imagesgoods/475763/sub/usgoods_475763_sub9_3x4.jpg?width=400,https://image.uniqlo.com/UQ/ST3/WesternCommon/imagesgoods/475763/sub/goods_475763_sub14_3x4.jpg?width=400

Francesco Risso
Creative Director of MARNI/Marni Creative Director, Francesco Risso approaches fashion-making as a gesamtkunstwerk, a total artwork: he merges languages and disciplines into a multifaceted whole, heralding a processual aesthetic that is embodied through interconnected media which are rooted in the materiality of clothing but come alive through the fashion show and collaborations. Involving like-minded entities into one seamless creative exchange, he fosters dialogue as the fuel of the brand to keep shaping Marni into a laboratorial community ruled by freewheeling multi-dimensionality.""Do we need to be like aliens to observe the miracle of creation, rather than the culture of destruction? In a nostalgic and simple vision of peace, an alien with sunglasses, sitting on a globe as if it was a Pilates ball launches the challenge: what I like about Planet Earth isn't found on Planet Earth.

ADAM SCOTT
Adam Scott was born on 16th July 1980 in Adelaide, Australia. He is one of the world's top golfers with the most consecutive starts as an active player. In April 2013, just after becoming a Global Brand Ambassador for UNIQLO, he became the first Australian to win a Masters championship. He established the Adam Scott Foundation in 2005, providing education opportunities for children and young people.
Along with peace and love, as a golfer, I hope for all things being “par”. Everything should be good, equal, and calm.

“UT Archive” is a project that revives carefully selected T-shirts which have been sold in the past. From the UT collection that has been on sale for about 20 years, popular patterns by Andy Warhol, Basquiat, and Keith Haring will be re-released.
Andy Warhol
As the preeminent American artist of the 20th Century, Andy Warhol challenged the world to see art differently. This product is produced under a license from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc., a New York not-for-profit corporation which promotes the visual arts.
Keith Haring
A key figure in New York’s East Village scene in the late 1970s and 80s, American artist Keith Haring’s artwork populated not only art galleries, but also the city’s subways, streets, and sidewalks. His work often combined an iconographic vocabulary, including hearts, flying saucers, winged figures, and a crawling “radiant baby,”with abstract marks and patterning.
Jean-Michel Basquiat
An icon of New York in the 1980s, Jean-Michel Basquiat became renowned during his short career for works inspired by his early street art and a distinctive iconography often connected to art history. His paintings, drawings, and prints drew on a diverse range of sources, from African, Aztec, and Greek cultures to Americana in the form of jazz, baseball, and social and political events.
